In this project I am working on implementing a simple ray tracer rendering program in Rust. I am going to be using the book "Ray Tracing in One Weekend", by Peter Shirley to guide me in this endeavor. The ray tracer in the book is written in c++ so I will be rewriting the code in Rust. If I finish this project with additional time left in the term I am planning on expanding the ray tracer with additional features.
